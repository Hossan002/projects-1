                The purpose of a mission statement is to communicate the organisation's purpose and direction to its
                employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders. A mission statement also creates a sense of
                identity for its employees.

                    How does a designer know which words to display, how to organize the pages, or which pages should
                    exist in the first place? These are not mysteries. It all comes from a vision statement.

                    As a web developer, we want to be able to design web pages that efficiently display documents,
                    provide interactivity and artistically appealing to users. To do this, we need to know the nuances
                    of web design and delivery and the different software tools and applications we can use.

                        rises time constraints make it more challenging to effectively control transmission.
